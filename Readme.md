      <h3> Container is a modern method of packaging and running software applications in a lightweight, portable, and consistent way. Instead of just writing code and hoping it works the same everywhere, containerization helps you bundle your application with everything it needs — like libraries, dependencies, and configuration files — into a single package called a container.</h3>
